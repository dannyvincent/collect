# Testing
This application uses mocha test framework (https://mochajs.org) and chai assertion library (http://chaijs.com)

## Installation
Make sure you have installed node.js from https://nodejs.org

Then run the following bash command from the root project path:
    npm install

## Usage
Tests should be thoughtfully added  under the `spec/` path, with references to all test and application scripts added to the `index.html` file.

The tests can then be run either by opening `index.html` in a browser or running the bash command `npm test` from the `test/` path.
